;This goal tests that the underwater sensor nets can successfully be deployed.
;It also tests that the science officer is able to scan a vortex. It also
;tests that an underwater base can be visited that is safe and without security.
;It also tests that the submarine can travel through a vortex with it's shields
;up successfully, it also tests that the submarine will be destroyed when it
;comes under attack from an enemy sub because (experiencedMissileSpecialist)
;is not initialised and the pressure shields are not to be activated in region3
;so the submarine cannot go into the vortex there. It will try to flee and will
;be destroyed.
