;This goal tests that the sick bay heals injured personnel as the captain
;will be injured because (underwaterBaseSafeIn region2) is not initialised and
;neither is (securityToAccomponyExpSubIn region2),
;it tests my additional feature of attacking an enemy - in this case
;successfully, and it also tests the entire implementation, returning to seaport
;with mineral samples, vortex studies, sensor nets on plains, and underwater 
;bases checked.
